# Crypto Convert
A simple web-app written with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It performs conversions between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies using the CoinGecko API for real time data.  

This is still work in progress and I'm looking to add more coins and change the selection system to a datalist type.  

The style is also very simple since I was just trying to make it no look terrible! In the future I'll design something more appealing for sure. <br><br>

## You can check the deployed app in the  following [link](https://fredericomozzato.github.io/crypto_convert/).<br><br>

Any feedback is very well appreciated as I'm looking to learn more about web development from more experienced developers!<br><br>
